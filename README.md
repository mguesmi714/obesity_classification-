# Obesity KNN Analysis

This project demonstrates the implementation of a **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm for analyzing obesity trends based on input features. The analysis aims to classify individuals into categories related to obesity based on specific attributes.

## Features
- **Data preprocessing**: Clean and prepare the dataset for model training.
- **KNN Model Implementation**: Build and train a K-Nearest Neighbors classifier.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assess the performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.
- **Data Visualization**: Present findings with graphs and plots.

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.7 or later
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries:
  - `numpy`
  - `pandas`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `scikit-learn`
